SQLite is a public domain C library for providing an implementation of SQL (Structured Query Language) in a serverless and self-contained file. This allows SQLite to be quickly applied to new problems while also providing a format that is easily distributed for collaborative projects. A brief survey of SQL and database concepts including their benefits will be followed up by example implementations of the Python SQLite module, sqlite3. Example usage of sqlite3 Connection, Cursor and Row objects will be provided with scenarios focusing primarily on creating, populating, and querying SQLite databases. SQLite is the perfect tool for providing the gains of relational databases to Python programmers without the additional hassles of configurations and servers.
